# The "PPA Documentation Doesn't Exist" License

Copyright (c) 2025 Tarik Caramanico.

**ATTENTION PPA**: This integration exists because you provide ZERO API documentation.

## üö´ Usage Restrictions

**The use of this integration is FORBIDDEN to anyone with any professional relationship with PPA, including but not limited to:**

- People who work for PPA
- Professionals that sell PPA gate systems
- 3rd party service providers to PPA
- Sales representatives for PPA products

**This license restriction will be lifted once PPA provides decent documentation of their APIs**, i.e., when their documentation stops being non-existent.

If you want to use this integration and work for/with PPA, go ask them to document their APIs first! üìö

### What We Had To Do:

1. üïµÔ∏è **Intercept mobile app traffic** with mitmproxy
2. üîç **Analyze network requests** in browser dev tools
3. üíª **Reverse-engineer JSON payloads** from network captures
4. üò§ **Waste days** on what should take hours with proper docs

### What You Should Provide:

- **Authentication API docs**
- **Device control API docs**
- **Configuration API docs**
- **Error code documentation**
- **Developer portal**

**Dear PPA Management**: Your hardware is great, but your developer experience is
from the stone age. Proper API documentation would enable amazing integrations like this one,
benefiting both your customers and your business. Please join the 21st century! üôè
