### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tarikbc/ha-ppa-contatto/releases)
2. Extract the `custom_components/ppa_contatto` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services** ‚Üí **Add Integration**
5. Search for "PPA Contatto" and select it
6. Enter your PPA Contatto email and password

## Configuration

### Through the UI

1. Navigate to **Configuration** ‚Üí **Integrations**
2. Click the **+** button to add a new integration
3. Search for "PPA Contatto"
4. Enter your credentials:
   - **Email**: Your PPA Contatto account email
   - **Password**: Your PPA Contatto account password

### Manual Configuration (Not Recommended)

This integration supports configuration through the UI only. Manual YAML configuration is not supported.

## Usage

### Switches

The integration creates switches for each gate and relay that is configured to be shown in your PPA Contatto account:

- **Gate switches**: Control gate opening/closing (e.g., `switch.abc12345_gate`) - Gates may stay open for extended periods
- **Relay switches**: Momentary button control (e.g., `switch.abc12345_relay`) - Relays activate briefly like a button press

### Sensors

Additional sensors provide detailed monitoring information:

- **Last Action**: Timestamp of the most recent activity (`sensor.abc12345_last_action`)
- **Last User**: Name of the user who performed the last action (`sensor.abc12345_last_user`)
- **Gate Status**: Current gate status with history (`sensor.abc12345_gate_status`)
- **Relay Status**: Current relay status with history (`sensor.abc12345_relay_status`)

### Number Entities

Configuration entities for hardware behavior:

- **Relay Duration**: Control relay pulse duration in milliseconds (`number.abc12345_relay_duration`)
  - Set to `-1` for on/off switch mode (relay stays on until turned off)
  - Set to any positive value (e.g., `1000`) for momentary button mode (relay pulses for that duration)
  - Range: -1 to 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds max)
  - Default: 1000ms (1 second pulse)

### Configuration Entities

Device settings and preferences:

- **Text Entities**: Custom device names for gates and relays
- **Switch Entities**: Enable/disable favorites, notifications, and visibility settings

> **Note**: Replace `abc12345` with your actual device serial number. The integration automatically discovers your devices from the API and creates entities using their serial numbers.

### Device Information

Each entity provides comprehensive attributes:

- **Basic Info**: Device ID, MAC Address, Firmware Version, User Role
- **Status**: Current and latest status from reports
- **Activity**: Last action timestamp and user
- **Behavior**: Gates can stay open; relays are momentary buttons
- **Comparison**: Both device status and report status for accuracy

### Automation Examples

```yaml
# Open gate when arriving home
automation:
  - alias: "Open Gate on Arrival"
    trigger:
      - platform: zone
        entity_id: person.john_doe
        zone: zone.home
        event: enter
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.abc12345_gate

# Send notification when someone opens the gate
automation:
  - alias: "Gate Activity Notification"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.abc12345_last_user
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_johns_phone
        data:
          message: >
            Gate activity detected!
            {{ states('sensor.abc12345_last_user') }}
            performed an action at
            {{ states('sensor.abc12345_last_action') }}

# Log relay activity with user information
automation:
  - alias: "Log Relay Activity"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.abc12345_relay_status
    action:
      - service: logbook.log
        data:
          name: "PPA Contatto"
          message: >
            Relay changed to {{ trigger.to_state.state }}
            by {{ states('sensor.abc12345_last_user') }}
          entity_id: sensor.abc12345_relay_status
```

## API Endpoints

The integration uses the following PPA Contatto API endpoints:

- **Authentication**: `https://auth.ppacontatto.com.br/login/password`
- **Device List**: `https://api.ppacontatto.com.br/devices`
- **Device Control**: `https://api.ppacontatto.com.br/device/hardware/{serial}`
- **Device Reports**: `https://api.ppacontatto.com.br/device/{serial}/reports`

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

- **Invalid Credentials**: Double-check your email and password
- **Network Issues**: Ensure Home Assistant can reach the PPA Contatto servers
- **Account Issues**: Verify your account is active and has device access

### Device Not Appearing

- Ensure the device is set to "show" in your PPA Contatto mobile app
- Check that the device is online and authorized
- Restart the integration if devices were recently added

### Control Issues

- Verify device is online and authorized
- Check Home Assistant logs for specific error messages
- Ensure your account has control permissions for the device

### Logs

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.ppa_contatto: debug
```

## Reverse Engineering Story üîç

This integration was built entirely through reverse engineering, as **PPA Contatto provides zero API documentation**. The development process involved:

- üïµÔ∏è **Traffic Interception**: Using mitmproxy to capture mobile app requests
- üîç **Network Analysis**: Browser dev tools to understand API calls
- üß™ **Endpoint Discovery**: Trial and error to find working endpoints
- üíª **Payload Reverse Engineering**: Figuring out JSON structures from mobile app traffic
- üò§ **Pure Determination**: Refusing to give up when nothing was documented

For the full story of our frustration with undocumented APIs, see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

## Disclaimer

This integration is not officially supported by PPA Contatto. Use at your own risk.

**Note to PPA Contatto**: If you're reading this, please consider providing API documentation. Your customers and the developer community would greatly appreciate it! üôè
